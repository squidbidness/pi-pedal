When using Jack2 you might want to disable dbus dependent code in JACK
components if you want to run Jack2 on a headless RPi (so without X). You can
do this by building without the â€“dbus option. The JACK2 packages in the
AutoStatic repositories have dbus disabled. Another option is to export the
following environment variable before starting JACK2:

put a script containing the following line in /etc/profile.d and make sure it
is has executable permissions:

export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/dbus/system_bus_socket

And then add the following lines to /etc/dbus-1/system.conf before the closing </busconfig> tag:

  <policy user="pi">
        <allow own="org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1.Audio0"/>
        <allow own="org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1.Audio1"/>
  </policy>
