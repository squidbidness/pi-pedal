Be sure to either build jackd2 without dbus support or to disable it with the following:

When using Jack2 you might want to disable dbus dependent code in JACK
components if you want to run Jack2 on a headless RPi (so without X). You can
do this by building without the â€“dbus option. The JACK2 packages in the
AutoStatic repositories have dbus disabled. Another option is to export the
following environment variable before starting JACK2:

put a script containing the following line in /etc/profile.d and make sure it
is has executable permissions:

export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/dbus/system_bus_socket

And then add the following lines to /etc/dbus-1/system.conf before the closing </busconfig> tag:

  <policy user="pi">
        <allow own="org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1.Audio0"/>
        <allow own="org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1.Audio1"/>
  </policy>


Running jackd with the following config seems fairly stable, though it has 10ms latency :-(

/usr/local/bin/jackd -R -P80 -v -t 2000 -s -d alsa -d hw:pisound -r 48000 -p 128 -n 4 -X seq
-R : Run real-time
-P : Use high real-time priority (80) (Bigger numbers seem to be higher priority)
-n : According to rumor, the Rapsberry Pi 3 can't handle the default of 2


Or, this is apparently stable, with cpuset support, and without running carla with a GUI:

cset shield --exec /usr/local/bin/jackd -- -R -P99 -v -t 2000 -s -d alsa -d hw:pisound -r 48000 -p 128 -n 2 -X seq
